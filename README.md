Phishing Website Detector
A powerful, interactive Streamlit app to analyze and detect potential phishing websites. The app checks for suspicious patterns, verifies SSL and WHOIS info, crawls for common sensitive paths, and checks against a customizable blacklist.

Features
Phishing Risk Analysis: Scores any website URL for phishing risk based on technical and content factors.

Blacklist Checking: Instantly flags known malicious domains using a customizable blacklist.json.

Directory & File Crawling: Scans for common sensitive directories and files (e.g., /admin/, /login/, robots.txt).

WHOIS & SSL Checks: Displays domain age, registrar, and SSL certificate details.

Content Analysis: Detects login forms, sensitive info requests, and suspicious scripts.

User Feedback: Collects user feedback for continuous improvement.

Modern UI: Clean, responsive interface with Streamlit.
