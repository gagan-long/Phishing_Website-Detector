                                             🛡️ Phishing Website Detector

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/pythmlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Streaense: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellowrful, interactive Streamlit app to analyze and detect potential phishing websites.

The app checks for suspicious patterns, verifies SSL and WHOIS info, crawls for common sensitive paths, checks against a customizable blacklist, and leverages multiple live threat intelligence feeds.
